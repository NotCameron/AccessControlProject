# AccessControlProject
A project for my computer security class. Basically, create a simple ACM for a manuscript editing process. Project only asks for proof of concept of a working ACM. The actual system is a secondary goal. It's not inherently secure by design, more just showing that I understand RBACs. Never touched Rust prior to this so pardon anything that's not standard best practice. I want to improve it once I've got my proof of concept submitted (e.g., Error handling)
